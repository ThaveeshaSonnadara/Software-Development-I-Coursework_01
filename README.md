# Software-Development-I-Coursework_01
# Coursework_01 at First year of IIT

# This is where I freshly start my coding practice in the very first semester at Informatics Institute of Technology,Sri Lanka

# In this coursework I had to design and implement a program to given outcomes and the requirment was a program to predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic year. 

# Also this is where I step into Python Programming Language.

# Learning Outcomes covered in this assignment,
          LO1 Analyse specific problems and design their solutions by applying appropriate                       algorithmic techniques;
          LO2 Apply programming concepts to implement solutions in the taught programming language;
          LO3 Implement and manipulate simple data structures;
          LO4 Use an integrated development environment to create programs to satisfy a simple                   specification.
